Chapter 4 : Trees And Graphs

General Agenda :
1. Brief Introduction
2. Problem Discussion 


Problem 1: 

Given a directed Graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between the two nodes


Problem 2 :
Implement a function to check if the tree is balanced or not. // Binary tree
Balancing : abs(height(leftSubtree) - height(rightSubtree)) <= 1


Problem 3:
Build Order : You are given a list of projects and list of dependencies. Find a build order in which will allow the projects to be built.
  
  // Flight [Delhi, Mumbai] [ "Mumbai, Bangalore]

Example:

projects : a,b,c,d,e,f
dependencies: [(a,d), (f,b), (b,d), (f,a), (d,c)]
Output : f,e,a,b,d,c
